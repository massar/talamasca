Talamasca is a networking daemon that connects to one, or more,
IRC networks as a client, while linking itself to another network
and mirroring all the joins/parts/topic's/msg's etc to the linked
network and vice versa.

When using this utility I request that you do not remove/change any
of the Copyright lines that can be made visible using !info or
!version through the BitlBee interface, /info and /version over IRC.
You can strip the version number, or just set it to something bogus,
if you think that showing version numbers can be security risk.
Note that Talamasca is GPL, thus any change you make to it must be
published. Read the FAQ for some other details.

I also like to request to notify me that you are using this service,
then I can put this on the website of Talamasca and I also know that
people like it :)
