Ingredients
~~~~~~~~~~~
One will need the following ingredients depending on what you want
to link together:
 - A host to run Talamasca on.
 - A real IRC Server where you have a C/N pair on.
 - Connectivity between those ;)

At least one:
 - BitlBee account with MSN/ICQ/Jabber/Meanwhile/* accounts.
and/or a:
 - I-lines to allow access to IRC as a user.

Configuring the Bee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Setup a BitlBee server of your own, do not use a public one.
Then, using a normal IRC client, create an account and add the
accounts you would like to have linked to an IRC channel.

Then, quite important, configure the following settings:
8<----------------------------
auto_reconnect true
private true
handle_unknown add
display_namechanges true
buddy_sendbuffer true
query_order fifo
---------------------------->8
This will make sure that BitlBee automatically reconnects when
there is an error in an account, messages will be sent to the
user, unknown handles are added, so they can then request a
permanent !add, realname changes are broadcasted and whois updated
and lastly that BitlBee does some buffering otherwise we might just
flood one of the accounts, especially with the !help output etc.

Do not forget to type 'save', though the save_on_quit might catch it.

Of course 'typing_notice' should be false...
Keep the others on their defaults too
Do not set the html strip option as it will strip the !help output...

More information about BitlBee can be found on http://www.bitlbee.org

Normal IRC Link
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Not much to do here, just configure it in Talamasca ;)

Creating a Talamasca Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the tricky part as you will need to do linking etc.

Notes
~~~~~
* Looplinking in general is a bad idea and totally your fault
  if it happens.

* Do not add an account of one Talamasca's MSN/ICQ/etc to another
  Talamasca this will give mayhem as Talamasca does not grab the
  "### " prefixed messages nor parses them, thus can never say
  !add or other commands to resolve the issue.
  Looping them this way is most probably a bad idea anyway.
